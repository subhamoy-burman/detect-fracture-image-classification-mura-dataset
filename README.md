## Introduction

The goal of this project is to classify musculoskeletal radiographs as either normal or abnormal. The MURA (Musculoskeletal Radiographs) dataset is a large dataset of bone X-rays, which is used to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset

The MURA dataset is provided by Stanford and can be downloaded from here. The dataset consists of images organized into training and validation sets.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mura-classification.git
cd mura-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
